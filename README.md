# CoffeeApp Discovery

My First Impressions:
How can I make a coffee app that can help small/medium sized coffee companies connect with more people nation wide. It will be a coffee brand distributor app.   

Asking Others:
I ask some people in our classroom about GoodReads:
1. How do you find out about good coffee?
2. Would you order coffee for home delivery if the deal was convenient & affordable?
3. What do you look for in a coffee brand?

-Person one said that word of mouth was their main way of learning about new coffee brands. They would be open to the idea of home delivery. They look for fair trade practices & sustainability.  
-Person two said that word of mouth was their main way of learning about new coffee brands but they also just go out and try new brands. They would be open to the idea of home delivery. They look for nice packaging & the right smell/taste.  
-Person three said that word of mouth was their main way of learning about new coffee brands. They don’t drink enough coffee to justify home delivery. They look for a good price.  
-Person four doesn’t drink coffee.  
-Person five said they just go out & try new brands to learn about good coffee. They would be open to the idea of home delivery. They look for fair trade practices, sustainability, & price.  

Competitors:
